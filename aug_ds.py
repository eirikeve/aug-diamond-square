# Augmented, Randomized Diamond Square Algorithm implementation
# Written by Eirik Vesterkj√¶r, Dec 2017
#
# This is a modified version of the diamond square algorithm.
# The reason it was written, was to use a DS-like algorithm for arrays with side lengths
# that are not 2^n + 1
# It accepts (non-jagged) 2D arrays of any (sensible) side lengths.
# It uses randomization to select indexes, and interpolation when a nx1 length remains unfilled.
# Print/plot functions are also supplied. Plotting requires matplotlib and numpy.
