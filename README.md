# aug-diamond-square
Augmented Diamond Square algorithm implementation. 
For 2D arrays of any size - not just squares of side length 2^n + 1.

## Non-square 2D arrays
Can be used with any 2D array - including non-square ones.

## Usage
With a 2D array m initialized with zeroes as input, call
```python
  randAugDS(m, seed)
```
Seed can be any integer.  
See `exampleCall()` in [the source](aug_ds.py).
